# Books-Recommendation-System
This projects implements and compares the effectiveness of collaborative
filtering and content-based filtering in predicting user ratings for movies. By employing regression and matrix factorization
techniques, we aim to develop predictive models that can accurately estimate user ratings. 
Additionally, we seek to understand the strengths and
limitations of each approach and identify scenarios where one might outperform the other.
